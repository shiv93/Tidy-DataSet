DESCRIPTION OF REMAINING VARIABLES:-

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAccelerometer-XYZ and timeGyroscope-XYZ for the X,Y,Z axis respectively. These features were captured at a frequency of 50Hz interval.
The accelerometer signals were separated as TimeBodyAccelerometer and FrequencyBodyAccelerometer.

The gyroscope signals were similarly separated as TimeBodyGyroscope and FrequencyBodyGyroscope.

The signals were separated using Low Pass Butterworth filters with a corner frequency of 0.30Hz
Subsequently the jerk signals were obtained for all X,Y,Z axes as timeBodyAccelerometerJerk and timeBodyGyroscopeJerk.

The magnitude of TimeBodyAccelerometermagnitude, TimeBodyGyroscopemagnitude,  timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude, timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitutde, timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude were calculated using Euclidean norm.

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing FrequencyBodyAccelerometer, FrequencyBodyAcceleroemeterJerk, frequencyBodyGyroscope, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude for each of the X,Y,Z 
axes. 

The Mean and Std represent the Mean and the Standard Deviation of each variable respectively.

DATA SOURCE:-
Data set has been taken from the following website:-
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
There were basically two sets of data:-
1. Training set (70% of the volunteers)
2. Test set		(30% of the volunteers)

Steps performed to get the tidy dataset:-
1. Merged the test and the training data set.
2. Retrieved only the mean and the standard deviation measurements (referring to the features.txt)
3. Named the activities by cbinding it to the merged dataset(referred to activity_labels.txt)
4. Named the measurement variables (referring to the features.txt)
5. Displayed the data with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
